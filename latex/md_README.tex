{\bfseries{IRC}} $\ast$(Internet Relay Chat)$\ast$ is a text-\/based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-\/on-\/one communication via private messages, as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

Yes, it\textquotesingle{}s a chat system, but it\textquotesingle{}s also a protocol. The protocol is a set of rules that clients and servers use to communicate with each other. The protocol is defined in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459}{\texttt{ RFC 1459}} and \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812}{\texttt{ RFC 2812}}. This project is, basically, the older brother of another project we developed at 42, \href{https://github.com/jlbernardo/minitalk}{\texttt{ minitalk}}.
