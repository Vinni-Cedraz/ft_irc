# ✧˖°. IRC clients .°˖✧

As confusing as it may be, IRC clients are not only the users that connect to the server, but also <u>the software</u> used for it. These are applications that may be installed on your computer or used in a web browser and allow you to use the [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC).

Clients can vary a lot, but most will have the same basic features: connect to a server, join channels, send messages, and receive messages. Some clients may have **additional features**, such as scripting, themes, or integration with other services.

There are many clients for the various operating systems. On Windows, for example, you may use [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC), which scripting language can be used to make minor changes to the program, like creating custom commands (aliases), changing the program's appearance and customizing its behaviours.

Some programs which are extensible through plugins, can also serve as platform for IRC clients. This is the case of [ERC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC_(software)), a client **integrated in the Emacs text editor** written in [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp). Its features include message timestamping, automatic channel logging, highlighting of text and auto-completion of nicks and commands. With a <u>modular design</u>, it can be customized with a bunch of different loadable modules that change the program's behaviour.

In the beginning of 2024, one of the most popular Windows and Unix-like clients, [HexChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HexChat), was discontinued. The program was a fork of XChat, which was replaced in 2015. The application was shut down due to the lack of developers and the increasing difficulty to maintain the software. While it was still active, however, it was a popular choice for many users, with the options of tabbed document or tree interfaces, support for multiple servers, and numerous customization possibilities.

For those who prefer to not install a program on their computer, it's possible to use a web-based client, like [Mibbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mibbit), [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/) or [gamja](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/). These are usually simple to use, but may lack some features that are present in standalone clients.

At the end of the day, the clients are like any other software: you should choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences. Some may prefer a simple client with few features, while others may want a more complex one with many customization options. For our small IRC implementation, we will use **[choice]** as our reference client,duw to its **[characteristics]**.
