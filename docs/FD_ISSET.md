FD_ISSET` is a macro used with the `select()` system call for I/O multiplexing. Let's break this down:

```cpp
if (!FD_ISSET(fd, &read_set)) continue;
```

Let me explain:

1. `select()` allows you to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets in our case) simultaneously
2. `read_set` is a `fd_set` structure (think of it as a bit array where each bit represents a file descriptor)
3. `FD_ISSET` checks if a specific file descriptor (`fd`) is marked as "ready to read" in the `read_set`

Here's a practical example:

```cpp
// Simplified example of how select() and FD_ISSET work
void Server::start() {
    while (true) {
        // 1. Create a copy of master_set_ because select() modifies the set
        fd_set read_set = master_set_;

        // 2. select() blocks until any fd is ready for reading
        // After select() returns, read_set contains only the ready-to-read fds
        select(max_fd_ + 1, &read_set, NULL, NULL, NULL);

        // 3. Check each possible fd
        for (int fd = 0; fd <= max_fd_; fd++) {
            // 4. FD_ISSET checks if this fd is ready to read
            if (!FD_ISSET(fd, &read_set))
                continue;  // Skip if fd is not ready

            if (fd == server_fd_) {
                // New connection coming
                handle_new_connection();
            } else {
                // Existing client sent data
                handle_client_message(fd);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Think of it like this:
```plaintext
master_set_ = [0,1,1,0,1]  // fd 1, 2, and 4 are being monitored
                           // (after FD_SET was called for these fds)

select() blocks until data arrives...
Client sends data on fd 2...

read_set = [0,0,1,0,0]    // After select(), only fd 2 is marked as ready

FD_ISSET(2, &read_set) returns true   // Data available on fd 2
FD_ISSET(1, &read_set) returns false  // No data on fd 1
FD_ISSET(4, &read_set) returns false  // No data on fd 4
```

This mechanism allows your server to:
1. Monitor multiple client connections simultaneously
2. Only process sockets that actually have data
3. Not waste CPU time checking empty connections
4. Handle both new connections and client messages efficiently
