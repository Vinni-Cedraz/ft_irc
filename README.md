# ft_irc, the messager

**IRC** *(Internet Relay Chat)* is a text-based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages, as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

Yes, it's a chat system, but it's also a protocol. The protocol is a set of rules that clients and servers use to communicate with each other. The protocol is defined in [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) and [RFC 2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812). It is the older brother of another project we developed at 42, [minitalk](https://github.com/jlbernardo/minitalk).
